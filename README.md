DijkstraCoin 

DijkstraCoin (Dijkstra) is a new digitally encrypted currency, which adopts a typical algorithm of shortest path, to calculate the shortest path from node to node. 
The characteristics of the network expands from the centre outwards, layer by layer, until it reaches the end. 
CPU + GPU mining model ensures equal distribution of benefits of the miners, and to bring in recognition algorithms will effectively prevent automated mining pool access, and effectively resist ASIC mining machine, 
which saves more than 50% energy than scrypt, meaning it’s more environmentally friendly.
Combining POW + POS technologies, and utilising the method of acquired stake in the equity allocation will ensure sustainable earnings. 
Dijkstra algorithm, with its efficient calculating ability, expedites P2P transactions, and achieves instant money transfer. That said, it brings more benefits when it’s for the commercial use.
